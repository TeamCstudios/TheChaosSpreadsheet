# Welcome to the Chaos Spreadsheet recap for the week of December 5, 2017

# Second Day!

Today is the second day of the spreadsheet's existance.

It is quite empty, but who cares?

# Letter Cloud?

A cloud of letters has appeared in the northwestern corner of the sheet. It is unknown who placed it or if it is protected or not.

At about noon today, it began to spread south towards the Example Space and the "history of the entire world" script. Speaking of...

# Bill Wurtz meme appears

MrJoCrafter created a large merge cell and pasted the script of "History of the Entire World" script into it. Of course, it didn't fully fit, but that didn't matter. Sadly, though, he set it to view only, so even he can't delete it.

# A bit of color

Near the northwestern corner, colors of light blue and purple began spreading.

# We march east!

Five new columns have been added to extend the eastern border.
